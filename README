# Illustration of Pixie's Foreign Function Interface

This simple library is designed for the illustration and test of foreign function
interfaces, mainly the PyPy Clojure Clone [Pixie](https://github.com/pixie-lang/pixie).

### Download, Build and Installation
The download and build process is done with the following shell commands:

    git clone git://github.com/linneman/libffitest.git
    cd libffitest

    autoreconf -i # generate configure script

    ./configure
    make
    make install # as root

Pay  attention to  the fact  that  the library  is per  default installed  under
`/usr/local/lib` which is  not in the library path on  many linux distributions.
Thus you will need to put `/usr/local/lib` to your library path e.g. by defining
the enviroment variable

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib.

Alternatively,  you  can  edit  `/etc/ld.so.conf`  which  contains  the  default
directories  searched.  Note  that  you  may  also  need  to  update  the  cache
`/etc/ld.so.cache` by running ldconfig (as root, or with sudo).

### Compile and Run the Test Applicaton in C

    cd example
    make
    ./ffitestexample

### Run the Test Application in Pixie
